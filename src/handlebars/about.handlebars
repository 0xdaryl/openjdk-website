        <p>
          This initiative came about following a discussion about the general lack of an open and reproducible build & test system for the OpenJDK source
          across multiple platforms.  Practically, it's a reboot of the work that has already been done for a while in the OpenJDK project producing binaries
          for developers and end users.
        </p>

        <p>
          The intention is to provide binaries and hardware access for all of the major platforms, for the purposes of:
          <ul>
            <li>Research and Development by academics, researchers and enthusiasts.</li>
            <li>An open, common, audited, build infrastructure for vendors to use (if they wish).</li>
            <li>Providing binaries for bleeding edge early adopters.</li>
            <li>Providing a place to try out build infrastructure ideas that might one day be moved to OpenJDK proper.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          Although we will be making the binaries to the highest quality possible via jtreg, jcov test coverage and possibly other donated test
          suites. It is <strong>not</strong> the intention that the binaries produced will be professionally supported. See
          <a href="./support.html">Support</a> for details.
        </p>

        <p>
          There may be some areas of overlap with other past/present efforts, but that's OK.  We expect any duplication to converge in due course and have
          started working with other platform specific OpenJDK build efforts.
        </p>

        <p>
          Discussions will take place on the <a href="http://mail.openjdk.java.net/mailman/listinfo/adoption-discuss">Mailing List</a>, or via
          the <a href="https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-build/issues">Github issues</a>; and consensus recorded on this project website or the appropriate GitHub repo wiki as appropriate.

        <h2 class="bold">Supported Forests</h2>
        <p>
          We'll start with jdk8u (effectively Java 8) with test coverage from the open jtreg tests, providing jcov test coverage reports. Later on other popular
          forests such as jdk9, jdk10, valhalla, shenandoah etc will be added.

        <h2 class="bold">Supported Platforms</h2>
        <p>
          We currently have Linux x64 and Mac OS X and are looking to rapidly add the other common Linux variants + Windows and Solaris.  We envisage some
          strong collaboration can form here with IcedTea and other specific platform efforts!

        <p>
          <a href="https://java.net/projects/adoptopenjdk/">AdoptOpenJDK</a> is a community of Java user group members, Java developers, Vendors who are
          advocates of <a href="http://openjdk.java.net">OpenJDK</a>, the open source project which forms the basis of the Javaâ„¢ programming language and
          platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          Part of the group's activities occur at the <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/groups/adoption/">Adoption Group</a> on OpenJDK proper where you
          can also join the <a href="http://mail.openjdk.java.net/mailman/listinfo/adoption-discuss">Mailing List</a>.
